What the Homework is About
=====================

There's a game called twenty questions where you need to guess what
someone is thinking of within twenty questions, and you can only ask
yes or no questions.

But when humans play the game, the questions are fairly simple
... people get pretty annoyed if you ask a question like "Is this a
dog, cat, elephant, or bagel?"

This is called "yes and no" in the UK, "Was bin ich" in Germany, and
probably many other things around the world.

But we're going to allow you to ask any yes or no question you like as
long as it can be expressed in a logical form.

What are the Possible Answers
=====================


If your thesis is utterly vauous
Use first-order prediate calulus
With sufficient formality
The sheerest banality
Will be hailed by the critics: "Miraulous!"
